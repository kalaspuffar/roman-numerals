# roman-numerals
Small challenge to create a good algorithm for roman-numerals.

You may clone this repository and implement your own function for roman numerals. And if you want show case it here by 
creating a PR with your branch. Love to see what you come up with. My own implementation will be available as a branch 
called kalaspuffar.
